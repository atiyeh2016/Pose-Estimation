Leeds Sports Pose Dataset
Sam Johnson and Mark Everingham
http://sam.johnson.io/research/lsp.html

This dataset contains 2000 images of mostly sports people
gathered from Flickr. The images have been scaled such that the
most prominent person is roughly 150 pixels in length. The file
joints.mat contains 14 joint locations for each image along with
a binary value specifying joint visibility.

The ordering of the joints is as follows:

Right ankle 0,1
Right knee 2,3
Right hip 4,5
Left hip 6,7
Left knee 8,9
Left ankle 10,11
Right wrist 12,13
Right elbow 14,15
Right shoulder 16,17
Left shoulder 18,19
Left elbow 20,21
Left wrist 22,23
Neck 24,25
Head top 26,27

This archive contains two folders:
images - containing the original images
visualized - containing the images with poses visualized
